  calculateGeometricMean:
    description: |
      Compute the geometric mean of a list of non-negative numbers. 
      The geometric mean is useful in fields like finance for averaging rates of return, or in growth rates.
      This function assumes all inputs are non-negative. If negative numbers are provided, 
      the result might not be meaningful or could result in an error.

          // Compute the product of all numbers, then take the nth root where n is the count of numbers
          const product = input.numbers.reduce((acc, num) => acc * num, 1);
          const geoMean = Math.pow(product, 1 / input.numbers.length);
          return { geometricMean: isNaN(geoMean) ? 0 : geoMean }; // Return 0 if result is NaN
